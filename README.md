### Note
### For a full summary of the results of each model and how it performed compared to others, please refer to the Project Explanation PDF.

## Overview
This project serves as the Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It explores the World Happiness Report dataset, examining different models for predicting a country’s happiness score based on the data provided in the dataset.

## Objectives
### The objectives of this project are to:

#### Build Various Models: Develop different predictive models including:

#### Linear Regression
#### Multiple Linear Regression
#### k-Nearest Neighbors
#### Decision Tree

#### Accurately Predict Happiness Scores: Use the models to predict countries’ happiness scores.
#### Analyze Model Performance: Understand why certain models performed better than others by analyzing their performance metrics and underlying mechanisms.

## Project Structure
### Folders
### Models
 The Models folder contains multiple subfolders, each dedicated to a different predictive model. Each model’s subfolder includes:

Markdown Script: Annotated code and explanations for the model.
#### Data and Graphs: A subfolder containing the model's performance data and plots generated by the scripts.
Data and Graphs
The Data and Graphs subfolder includes:

Performance Data: Metrics and evaluation results for the model.
Plots: Visualizations generated from the model's analysis scripts.
Plots
The Plots folder houses all the plots generated from various scripts throughout the project. This includes visualizations such as scatter plots, regression lines, performance metrics charts, and more.

### Data
The Data folder is organized into two subfolders:

Raw Data: Contains the unprocessed dataset as obtained from the World Happiness Report.
Cleaned Data: Includes datasets that have been cleaned and preprocessed using SQL for analysis and modeling.
Scripts
The Scripts folder contains useful scripts utilized throughout the project. These scripts include:

Data cleaning and preprocessing scripts
Data manipulation and transformation scripts
Utility scripts for repetitive tasks
### SQL
The SQL folder includes all SQL scripts and tables used in the project. This comprises:

SQL Scripts: Queries and commands used to clean and transform the raw data.
Tables: Database tables created and used for storing intermediate and final datasets.
Feel free to navigate through the folders to explore the detailed implementations, analyses, and visualizations associated with each model and aspect of the project.
