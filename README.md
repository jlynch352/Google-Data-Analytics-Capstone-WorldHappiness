### Overview

This project serves as the Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional
Certificate. It explores the World Happiness Report dataset, examining different models for
predicting a country’s happiness score based on the data provided in the dataset.


### Objectives

This project aims to build different models—Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression,
k-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree—to accurately predict countries’ happiness scores,
and analyze these models to understand why certain models performed better than others

## Folders

### Models 

The models folder contains the more folders which each contain the markdown scripts for the model which contains the annoantated code for each model and the data and graphs folder. The data and graphs folder for each model contains any plot related to the model and a text file containg the information about the performance of the model.

### Plots

The plots folder contains any plot genrated from any scripts within this project

### data 

This folder contains two sub folder which respectively contain the raw data and the data cleaned from SQL

### Scripts

The scripts folder contains useful scripts I used throughout the project
