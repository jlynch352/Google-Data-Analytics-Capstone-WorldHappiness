# Google Capstone

## Note

For a full summary of the results of each model and how it performed compared to others, please refer to the [Project Explanation PDF](ProjectExplanation.pdf).

### Overview

This project serves as the Capstone project for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. It explores the **World Happiness Report** dataset, examining different models for predicting a country’s happiness score based on the data provided in the dataset.

### Objectives

The objectives of this project are to:

- **Build Various Models**: Develop different predictive models including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - k-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Tree

- **Accurately Predict Happiness Scores**: Use the models to predict countries’ happiness scores.

- **Analyze Model Performance**: Understand why certain models performed better than others by analyzing their performance metrics and underlying mechanisms.

### Skills Used

This project utilized a diverse set of skills and tools to effectively analyze the data and build predictive models. The key skills involved include:

- **SQL**
  - **Data Extraction & Transformation**: Writing complex queries to extract and preprocess data from databases.
  - **Data Cleaning**: Utilizing SQL for cleaning and organizing raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

- **R Programming**
  - **Statistical Analysis**: Performing exploratory data analysis and statistical testing.
  - **Model Building**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees.
  - **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful visualizations using libraries like ggplot and plotly to illustrate findings and model performance.

- **Data Analysis**
  - **Exploring Data**: Identifying patterns, trends, and groups within the dataset.
    
- **Building Models**
  - **Model Selection**: Choosing different models with different approaches to predictive modeling.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Assessing models using metrics such as RMSE and R-squared to determine their effectiveness.

- **Data Visualization**
  - **Plotting & Graphing**: Generating various different plots to visualize raw data, model outcomes, and certain model's innerworkings.
  - **Visual Story Telling**: Developed comprehensive visualizations to illustrate trends, patterns, and relationships within the data, facilitating a clear and engaging narrative of why you might make certain desicions when building a model.
   
- **Project Buiildig**
  - **Annotated Code**: Providing clear and detailed explanations within the code for better understanding and reproducibility.
  - **Reporting**: Compiling findings and methodologies into comprehensive reports and PDFs.
  - **Transfering Data and Files**: Moving data and files from one application or software from another. For example, I started this project in SQL then transfored it to R by using CSV files and Excel, and the finally uploaded the files to github. I also worked with file pahts as I excuted my JoinedTablesOnCountry.R internally in all my my R scripts, and saved their plots to the proper folders within the scipt using absolute paths.


## Project Structure

### Folders

#### Models

The Models folder contains multiple subfolders, each dedicated to a different predictive model. Each model’s subfolder includes:

- **Markdown Script**: Annotated code and explanations for the model.
- **Data and Graphs**: A subfolder containing the model's performance data and plots generated by the scripts.

##### Data and Graphs

The Data and Graphs subfolder includes:

- **Performance Data**: Metrics and evaluation results for the model.
- **Plots**: Visualizations generated from the model.

#### Plots

The Plots folder houses all the plots generated from various scripts throughout the project. 

#### Data

The Data folder is organized into two subfolders:

- **Raw Data**: Contains the unprocessed dataset as obtained from the World Happiness Report.
- **Cleaned Data**: Includes datasets that have been cleaned and preprocessed using SQL and R.

#### Scripts

The Scripts folder contains useful scripts utilized throughout the project. These scripts include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing scripts
- Data manipulation and transformation scripts
- Utility scripts for repetitive tasks

#### SQL

The SQL folder includes all SQL scripts and tables used in the project. This comprises:

- **SQL Scripts**: Queries and commands used to clean and transform the raw data.
- **Tables**: Database tables created and used for storing intermediate and final datasets.
