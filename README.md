## Note
#### For a full summary of the results of each model and how it performed compared to others go to the Project Explanation PDF

### Overview

This project serves as the Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional
Certificate. It explores the World Happiness Report dataset, examining different models for
predicting a country’s happiness score based on the data provided in the dataset.


### Objectives

This project aims to build different models—Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression,
k-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree—to accurately predict countries’ happiness scores,
and analyze these models to understand why certain models performed better than others


## Folders

### Models 

The models folder has multiple inner folders which each contain  the files relating to different model. In each model's file there is the markdown script for the model - which contains the annoantated code for each model - and the "Data and Graphs" folder. 
  #### Data and Graphs
  the data and graphs folder contains the models performance data and the plots generated by all the scripts

### Plots

The plots folder contains any plot genrated from any scripts within this project

### data 

This folder contains two sub folder which respectively contain the raw data and the data cleaned from SQL

### Scripts

The scripts folder contains useful scripts I used throughout the project

### SQL 

The folder contains the sql scripts and tables I used
